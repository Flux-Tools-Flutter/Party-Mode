# Party-Mode

Find your partying friends ðŸ¥³

This is a showcase app for flutter flux tools, an investigation on state management on flutter and the laboratory to develop something better, IMHO all the state management solutions suck, we need something better so lets build it :)

Knowing who of your friends is currently doing some social activity is a labor intensive and attention consuming activity, in order to know if one of your friends or contacts is the mood for a social activity you need to be constantly in contact with everyone, scrolling miles of facebuk and instogram feeds, looking at whatsopp statuses, etc. I just wanna know if someone wants to hangout right now so party mode was born

This app allows you to set your state as "partying" or "chilling" and inform to all of your contacts which are members of party mode that you are partying, at the same time it gives you a list of the friends that are partying, the distance from your location (whiout actually giving you their location) so you can know they are in a party mood or "party mode" and hang out with them ðŸ•º
